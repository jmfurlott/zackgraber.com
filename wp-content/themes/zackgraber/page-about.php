        <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>As a kid, I admired my older brother’s artistic abilities. I spent much of my time hiding in my bedroom recreating his drawings. By high school, my friends and I loved graffiti. We’d go out every weekend biking around Gainesville with backpacks full of paint, hoping we’d get noticed. I was crazy about sharing my work with as many people as possible, but was always afraid of how quickly they would disappear with a fresh coat of paint.</p>
          <p>After high school, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do with my life. I loved history, hated math, and spent a lot of energy on artistic ventures. I didn’t have the slightest idea what graphic design actually was until my first semester of Digital Arts and Design at Full Sail University. After three months, I was assigned a branding project and discovered how natural it felt. From then on I looked at every assignment through a branding lens.</p>
          <p>After I graduated from college, I started an internship at Parisleaf. At the time, it was a small studio with just 2 designers on staff. My first project was to design the logo for a local spa called Spa Royale. We had a time crunch, and I only had 25 minutes to make it happen. 15 of those minutes were spent being car-sick in the back of a Prius driving to the client meeting. The client loved it and the logo is now an enormous sign on the side of their building. When I saw them unveil the sign, that’s when my passion for branding took off.</p>

          <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
          <p>Every graphic design project is started to solve a problem. Maybe your sales stagnated and you want to attract a new crowd. Maybe you’re a startup who wants to get noticed and secure capital. Maybe you just want to make more money and you heard somewhere that good design is good business. Whatever your problem, an honest look at your branding can always help.</p>
          <p>But what does a logo have to do with anything? Branding isn’t purely aesthetics. It has a much greater potential. Branding is the process of defining who you are, identifying who you appeal to, and creating a plan to bring the two together. Sometimes that plan includes a new logo and some different graphics. But more often than not, good branding looks at business as a whole.</p>

            <p> When I was a kid, I was a huge fan of the BMX scene. I always found myself drawing logos on my bike frame or taking pictures for phony pedal ads.</p>
